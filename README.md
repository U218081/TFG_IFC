# SEMIAUTOMATIC SCORE-TO-TRACK ALIGNMENT SYSTEM

End of degree project made by Iv치n Fern치ndez Coca침o, directed by Antonio Jesus Mu침oz Montoro.

This repository contains the PDF of the project which contains the manual for using the application.
It also has the code for the application which is in the mAlignment folder.

The example contained in the data folder has been manipulated with this application to showcase what you 
can do with it. In the same way the results have been modified, you could interpolate the strange peak in the data to fix it. 
This data was used in the presentation for the project. (Remember that you must add the folder to the matlab path if you want to
load it when you are using the mAlignment)
